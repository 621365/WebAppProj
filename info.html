          <h2>What are the articles? </h2>
          <p>  
             The articles are all over the website extending through the hot page news to the home page. The top articles will be the most recent and interesting, and the lower you go, there will still be interesting news from earlier in the year or months. Our website also has an exciting and very unique option where you can submit any article you want to the website! Just fill out <a href="./submit.html">a form</a> of what your article is and <a href="./submit.html">submit it to the website</a>, where the request will be manually reviewed. Note: The articles generally must be appropriate and respectful to everybody, articles that are inappropriate or do not respect or try to offend any race, ethnicity, or any type of orientation will not be tolerated. Do note that these policies may depend on which editor you send the article for review to, and that the editors have the final say.

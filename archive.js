    "content": `<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68547871">By Thomas Mackintosh</a><br><br>Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan can be extradited to the UK, a Romanian court has ruled. Andrew Tate, 37, and Tristan, 35, were detained on Monday in Bucharest after Bedfordshire Police said it had obtained an arrest warrant. The brothers can be extradited only after the conclusion of their separate trial in Romania on human trafficking charges, a judge ruled. They have been released from custody. Speaking outside court Andrew Tate said: "We are very innocent men and in time everybody is going to see that. We are excited to finish this judicial process and clear our names." The brothers, who "categorically reject all charges", will remain under judicial controls in Romania which prevent them travelling outside the country. Before the extradition was granted by the Court of Appeal in Bucharest, Bedfordshire Police confirmed it had obtained the arrest warrant for two men in their 30s as part of an investigation into allegations of rape and human trafficking. "We understand this is a distressing subject, and people may be impacted by what they are seeing in the news," the force said in a statement. This content doesn't seem to be working. According to the brothers' legal representatives the allegations date back to 2012-2015. Speaking after they were released one of their lawyers, Eugen Vidineac, said: "We appreciate the Bucharest Court of Appeal's decision to postpone the extradition of Andrew and Tristan Tate. "This ruling provides an opportunity for the brothers to participate fully in their defence and for the legal process to proceed in a transparent manner." Romanian authorities are investigating separate allegations of rape, human trafficking and forming a criminal gang - charges the brothers deny. In December 2022, the brothers were arrested by Romanian authorities and eventually placed under house arrest in the town of Voluntari, on the outskirts of Bucharest. The house arrest was lifted in August last year but they were prevented from leaving Romania. They are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Mr Tate has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him. Speaking on Monday Mr Vidineac added: "Our clients are fully committed to actively participating in the legal process and defending their reputation. "We believe this rumour has originated from a popular online influencer who misconstrued a text message from our clients while streaming live. "There is simply no truth to it."`,

    "title": "US Spy Chief 'Cannot Rule Out' That China Would Use TikTok to Influence US Elections",
    "content": `<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-03-12/us-spy-chief-cannot-rule-out-that-china-would-use-tiktok-to-influence-us-elections">By Michael Martina and Patricia Zengerle</a><br><br>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China could use social media app TikTok to influence the 2024 U.S. elections, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a House of Representatives intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday. Asked by Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi if China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) would use TikTok to influence the elections, Haines said: "We cannot rule out that the CCP would use it." Krishnamoorthi is also the ranking Democrat on the House select committee on China. He and that panel's Republican chair Mike Gallagher last week introduced a bill that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the short video app used by 170 million Americans. The House is due to vote on Wednesday under fast-track rules that require two-thirds of members to vote "yes" for the measure to win passage. President Joe Biden said last week he would sign the bill, but the app is popular and getting legislation approved by both the House and Senate in an election year may be difficult. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community released on Monday said TikTok accounts run by a Chinese government propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022. Lawmakers have long voiced concerns that the Chinese government could access user data or influence what people see on the app, including pushing content to stoke U.S. political divisions. TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban. It was unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok could be divested in six months. Also speaking at the House hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray repeated his assessment that TikTok posed national security threats. "Americans need to ask themselves whether they want to give the Chinese government the ability to control access to their data," Wray said, adding that it could ultimately "compromise their devices."`,

But she had already been gone for days when that report was filed, and an earlier statement from police asking the public for information about her whereabouts noted that Bradley had not been seen since leaving her home on Feb. 18. In that statement, police said she \"\"reportedly drove away from the location in her silver 2014 Chevrolet Cruze,\"\" which had a Florida license plate and \"\"a noticeable dent on the trunk.\"\"<br><br>Police had not yet found Bradley's car when they issued their latest update about her case. Homicide detectives will continue to search for the vehicle as their investigation continues, and they have asked community members to report any information about Bradley's death, or her missing car, to the local Crime Stoppers line.<br><br>Before her body was found, Bradley's friends and family told WTVF that they were concerned for her safety. Her friends, who hung flyers around Nashville with details about her disappearance, said there were tips after Bradley went missing that suggested she was in danger, like the fact that her emotional support dog was found alone at her home, where the heater was still running. They also told WTVF that it was unusual for days to pass without Bradley contacting her parents.\"","author":"Emily Mar Czachor"}

The spacecraft was expected to make a hard landing. And the Starship spacecraft made it much further into flight than during two previous tests in 2023.<br><br>The company routinely frames failures during these early test flights as normal. The goal of these flight tests is to gather crucial data so that engineers can go back and tinker with Starship, improving it for future missions.<br><br>The Starship vehicle — which includes the upper Starship spacecraft and a rocket booster known as the Super Heavy — took off from SpaceX’s private Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 8:25 a.m. CT (9:25 a.m. ET).<br><br>SpaceX considers the Starship system crucial to its founding mission: to carry humans to Mars for the first time. And critically, NASA has chosen Starship as the landing vehicle that will ferry its astronauts to the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission slated to take off as soon as September 2026.<br><br>“Congrats to SpaceX on a successful test flight! Starship has soared into the heavens. Together, we are making great strides through Artemis to return humanity to the Moon— then look onward to Mars,” wrote NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on X, formerly known as Twitter.<br>The booster was expected to make an autonomous, controlled landing in the ocean, but the booster “didn’t light all the engines that we expected and we did lose the booster,” Huot said.<br><br>SpaceX said it’s working to get video of what occurred before the booster hit the water. But the the booster made it farther into flight than a Super Heavy booster has previously made it. On the past two flights, Super Heavy was destroyed midair before it had a chance to try out landing maneuvers.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the “mishap” involving both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. The agency licenses commercial rocket launches and oversees mishap investigations when spacecraft are lost during flight. Such investigations are routine and carried out whether or not SpaceX expects a loss of the vehicle.<br><br>“A mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-3 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on March 14,” according to a statement released by the FAA. “No public injuries or public property damage have been reported.

He was sent to a patriotic camp near the capital where flag-waving staff praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and tried to teach him nationalistic songs.<br><br>The Ukrainian teenager was given a Russian passport and sent to a Russian school. And then, in the fall of 2023, not long before his 18th birthday, he received a summons from a Russian military recruitment office.<br><br>Yermokhin, who’s now back in Ukraine and recovering from his ordeal in Kyiv, told CNN he believed this was the last step in Russia’s attempt to bully him into submission – a bid to sign him up as a soldier to fight against his own people.<br><br>“(I was told that) Ukraine was losing, that children were used for organ donations there, and that I would be sent to war right away. I told them that if I was sent to the war, at least I would fight for my own country, not for them,” he said.<br><br>Yermokhin was part of a group of children known as the “Mariupol 31,” who were taken to Russia. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 20,000 children have been forcibly transported to Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. More than 2,100 children remain missing, according to official statistics, but the government says the real number could be much higher.<br><br><br>Last March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin and the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, for their alleged role in abducting and deporting Ukrainian children. Russia has publicly acknowledged the transfer of Ukrainian children without guardians, despite some having guardians or parents.<br><br>Ukraine’s human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets said his office was convinced that Russia’s efforts to turn Ukrainian teenagers deported to Russia – or living in occupied areas of the east – into soldiers were part of a wider drive by Putin to erase the Ukrainian identity. It is also an opportunity for Moscow to replenish its forces on the front lines.<br><br>“It’s not theoretical,” he said. “We now have examples of forcible mobilization of Ukrainian people. All Ukrainian teenagers held in Russia, when they turn 18, they are put on a (recruitment) list of Russian military,” told CNN.<br><br>(I was told that) Ukraine was losing, that children were used for organ donations there, and that I would be sent to war right away. I told them that if I was sent to the war, at least I would fight for my own country, not for them.”<br><br>Bohdan Yermokhin<br><br>According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, it is illegal under the Geneva Conventions for an occupying power to compel or pressure the local population to serve in its armed forces. Human Rights Watch has said Russia is committing a war crime by doing so.<br><br>But Lubinets told CNN that Ukrainian authorities have seen Russian officials do just that in occupied areas, compelling Ukrainians to serve. The conscription efforts start with the opening of regional offices for various Russian government departments, including health and social services.<br><br>Yermokhin said he went through the entire process described by Lubinets — although he said the Russians didn’t seem very consistent at times.<br><br>“I was always told that I was from Russia and that I was born in Russia, that there is no Ukraine, and that it simply did not exist, that Mariupol was Russia. But in my Russian passport, my place of birth was listed as ‘Ukraine, the city of Mariupol,’” he said, smirking.<br><br>Lvova-Belova herself confirmed that Yermokhin received a Russian passport and military summons. In a statement posted on her Telegram channel in November she said that the summons was not unusual, because “all citizens of Russia receive” it. She said that since Yermokhin was still a student, he would be able to defer his military service until after finishing his education.<br><br>‘We are losing these children’<br>Many of the children deported to Russia came from socially vulnerable Ukrainian families. Some had been orphaned or were placed in foster homes when their birth parents became unable to care for them.<br><br>It’s these children that Mykola Kuleba is most worried about. He heads Save Ukraine, a Kyiv-based non-governmental organization that specializes in bringing deported children back to Ukraine.<br><br>“We are losing these children. Many of them will never come back because they are growing up with this poison, with this horrible propaganda, they are very vulnerable to it,” he said.<br><br>Yermokhin said he saw this firsthand. He spent years living with foster families and in group homes after losing his parents as a small child and was in a boarding school in Mariupol when Russian troops took over the city in May 2022.<br><br>“Many of us were abandoned by our guardians, abandoned by foster parents during the war… and then the Russians come in and they act in this hypocritical way, offering warmth and pretending that they care, and these children see this and think, well, this is better than it was there (in Ukraine),” Yermokhin said.","author":"Ivana Kottasová"}

Another High Court loss came when he sought billions of dollars in damages from the same state government over its decision to block his access to compensation over an iron ore project.<br><br>He’s now taking that to an international tribunal, seeking almost $200 billion in damages from the federal government.<br><br>Then there’s his bids for political office, as the founder of the United Australia Party, registered in 2018, whose policies included an Australian Bill of Rights and bans on Covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates.<br><br>He famously spent millions of dollars on advertising for very little electoral return, and the party was deregistered in 2022.<br><br>Now the pandemic has passed, and cruise ships are once again at sea, Palmer said the time is right to revive his Titanic dream.<br><br>“We are very pleased to announce that after unforeseen global delays, we have reengaged with partners to bring the dream of Titanic ll to life. Let the journey begin,’’ Palmer said in a press release.<br>The plans are very similar to previous iterations, checked to ensure they comply with current regulations.<br><br>Tenders are being sought, with plans to confirm a ship builder by the end of the year, to begin work in the first quarter of 2025.<br><br>Right now, Palmer expects the winning bidders to be based in Europe. He doesn’t believe Chinese standards are up to the task, he told reporters.<br><br>At the relaunch, his team distributed an eight-minute video that’s been around for several years, showing the layout of the ship and how each room will look, complete with actors dressed in period costume.<br><br>Passengers will be encouraged to dress for the 1900s, but it’s not mandatory, a spokesperson said.<br><br>The ship itself will be 269 meters (833 feet) long and 32.2 meters (105 feet) wide  – slightly wider than the original. Capacity will be 2,345 passengers spread across nine decks with 835 cabins. Almost half of those will be reserved for first class passengers.<br><br>Third class passengers will be treated to stew and mash at long tables in a communal dining room – as they were on the original boat – though a spokesperson said other meals will also be available for those who want a less authentic experience.<br>More than a century after the Titanic went down, researchers and historians remain captivated by its story.<br><br>The tragedy inspired James Cameron’s Oscar-winning 1997 blockbuster “Titanic,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and has fascinated amateur explorers drawn to the wreck.<br><br>One such mission ended in tragedy in June last year when all five passengers aboard the Titan submersible were killed when the vessel suffered a catastrophic implosion en route to the wreckage.<br><br>Palmer wants to replicate the Titanic – without the tragic ending – and he also wants world peace.<br><br>“We all know how to make war. We get armies and we fund wars. People know about that. But it is a lot harder to make peace. To make peace you have got to stick with it every day. You progress inch by inch,” he said in the press release.<br><br>“Titanic ll is something that can provide peace. It can be a ship of peace between all countries of the world.<br><br>“Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic ll will be the ship where those dreams come true,’’ Palmer said.","author":"Hilary Whiteman"}

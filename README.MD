# Gabriel-Chyler News

This is the repository for the Web Project Gabriel-Chyler News (abbreviated as GCN). This site contains an advanced search ability, an archive viewer, media articles, and the ability to "submit" articles. As this site has no back-end, the "database" is a JavaScript file, and "submitting" articles is simply emailing the articles to the editors so that they can add the article to the JavaScript archive. As or right now, the site is finished except for two minor problems listed below:

- Information page was mistaken as an attack by Chrome.
- Article Viewer may be too tiny

Besides those two issue, the site is complete "as-is." It features a CSS-media dark theme, a basic search page with basic filters, and an interactive create article form. We hope you enjoy.

## Setting Up

The PWA Functionality requires that the hosted domain use HTTPS or that the server is local. The offline capability requires that you change the domain name in the code to your curent domain, as it is set up to only cache websites in its own domain.
